# setup-turn-server-ubuntu
This repo documents a production-ready TURN setup for WebRTC using coturn on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, fronted by a Cloudflare DNS subdomain, plus a tiny Node/Next.js API that issues time-limited TURN REST credentials. Itâ€™s the end-to-end notes I wish I had: copy-pasteable commands, sane defaults, and gotchas called out.
